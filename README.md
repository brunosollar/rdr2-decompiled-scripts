Decompiled scripts from **RDR2** (`rdr2_script_rel`), **RDO** (`rdr2_script_mp_rel`) and **GTA5 & GTAO** (`gta5_script_rel`).

You can download the decompiled scripts from the [Releases](https://github.com/brunosollar/decompiled-scripts/releases) section.

These scripts were decompiled using [Maybegreat48’s GTA-V-Script-Decompiler fork](https://github.com/maybegreat48/GTA-V-Script-Decompiler) with an updated version of [Alloc8or’s native database](https://github.com/alloc8or/gta5-nativedb-data).
