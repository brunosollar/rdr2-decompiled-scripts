# rdr2-decompiled-scripts

Decompiled scripts from **Red Dead Redemption 2** (`script_rel`) and **Red Dead Online** (`script_mp_rel`).

These scripts were decompiled using [Maybegreat48’s GTA-V-Script-Decompiler fork](https://github.com/maybegreat48/GTA-V-Script-Decompiler) with an updated version of [Alloc8or’s native database](https://github.com/alloc8or/rdr3-nativedb-data).

You can download the decompiled scripts from the [Releases](https://github.com/brunosollar/rdr2-decompiled-scripts/releases) section.
